# Analyse-home-advantage-in-Football-using-pairedT-test
We used paired t-test to analyze if home Advantage exists in football, and how it was affected by Covid lockdown restrictions.

The Covid-19 pandemic has left its impact on various fields across the globe including literal football fields. Covid lockdown restrictions resulted in games being played behind closed doors, without the “12th man”, the fans. Many claimed that this will have a huge impact on the “home advantage”, without the 80,000 fans singing anthems and chants to encourage the players to give their all or by pressuring the referee to
give calls in their favor. The main factors for home advantage were believed to be crowd support, referee bias, travel fatigue and familiarity,  but there was no consensus on what was the main driver. The covid pandemic provided us with a chance to come to a conclusion whether the “12th man” was really an advantage.
